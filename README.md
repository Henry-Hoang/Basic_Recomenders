## NTU Cx1115: Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

Using movies dataset from [TMDb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and ratings dataset from [Movilens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) 
to implement and test three basic recommendation systems:
  1. Content-based Recommender: Use TF-IDF and Vector Space Model to find the most relevant movies to a particular one.
  2. Collaborative Filtering Recommender: Use SVD model from Surprise library.
  3. Hybrid-based Recommender: Combine the above two approaches.
